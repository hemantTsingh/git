🚨 AWS Security & Threat Detection Stack

Think: "Detect bad things BEFORE and AFTER they happen"

🔥 AWS GuardDuty

✔ Continuous threat detection
✔ Detects:

Compromised EC2, IAM keys usage

Crypto-mining behavior

Suspicious API calls

Malicious IP contacts

S3 data exfiltration attempts

🧠 Use cases to remember:
➡ “User logged in from an unusual country”
➡ “EC2 instance making outbound DNS calls to known malicious domains”
➡ “S3 bucket data being accessed unusually”

👉 GuardDuty is detection only (no auto remediation)

🔍 AWS Inspector

Think: "Security vulnerability scan"

✔ Detects:

OS-level vulnerabilities

Unpatched CVEs

Open ports

Weak configurations

✔ Works on:

EC2

Lambda

ECR images

🧠 Remember:

Inspector = vulnerability scan

GuardDuty = threat detection & anomaly monitoring

🛑 AWS Security Hub

Think: Central dashboard of your security posture

✔ Aggregates:

GuardDuty alerts

Inspector findings

IAM Access Analyzer alerts

AWS Config compliance violations

✔ Gives security score (CIS, NIST frameworks)

🧠 Handy when asked:

"Where will I get centralized risk visibility?"

🔐 AWS IAM Access Analyzer

Detects:
✔ Publicly accessible S3
✔ Cross-account IAM trust
✔ Public KMS keys
✔ Over-permissive IAM roles

💭 Example:

S3 bucket accidentally exposed publicly → Analyzer warns you

🚨 Amazon Macie

PII identification in S3
✔ Emails, PAN/Aadhaar formats, Names, Credit card info

📌 Used in Banking, Healthcare

🧠 Monitoring & Logging Stack (Your MUST-KNOW)
📊 CloudWatch

Think: metrics + alarms + dashboards

What it collects:

✔ EC2 CPU, memory (agent-based), network
✔ RDS, ELB, Lambda metrics
✔ Custom application logs
✔ Container logs

Components to recall:

✔ CloudWatch Metrics
✔ CloudWatch Alarms
✔ CloudWatch Logs
✔ Log Insights

🧠 Interview highlight:
🗣 "To restart pods automatically when CPU increases → Use CloudWatch Alarm → SNS → Lambda → Kubectl rollout restart"

📜 CloudTrail

Tracks:
✔ Who did What, When, From Where in AWS

Examples:
🔸 Deleted EC2 → logged
🔸 Created IAM user → logged
🔸 Modified security group rule → logged

Used for:
✔ Auditing
✔ Security forensics
✔ Change tracking

CloudWatch vs CloudTrail
Feature	CloudWatch	CloudTrail
Use Case	Metrics/Logs	API activity
Example	CPU = 80%	IAM user made SSH key
⚙️ Configuration & Governance Stack
🏛 AWS Config

Think: AWS State Tracking + Compliance

Tracks:
✔ Resource configuration changes over time
✔ If configuration violates policies

Example:
✔ A rule → "S3 bucket must not be public"
→ Config checks continuously

🧠 Powerful Interview Answer:

“AWS Config continuously checks real-time resource compliance while CloudTrail records who made the change.”

🧾 AWS Audit Manager

Used for compliance documentation
✔ SOX
✔ HIPAA
✔ PCI DSS

Not for beginners, but mention when interviewer goes deep.

🚧 Operational Security Components
🔐 AWS KMS

✔ Encrypts EBS, S3, RDS, Kinesis, Lambda

Key terms:

CMK

Envelope encryption

Key rotation

🔑 AWS Secrets Manager

✔ Stores DB passwords, API keys
✔ Rotates secrets automatically

Comparison:

Parameter Store = basic

Secrets Manager = auto-rotation

📡 Networking Security
🔥 AWS Firewall Manager

Central management for AWS WAF, SG rules

AWS WAF

Blocks:

SQL injection

Cross-site scripting (XSS)

Apply on:
✔ CloudFront
✔ API Gateway
✔ ALB

📈 AWS Observability for Kubernetes
Use in EKS cluster:

✔ CloudWatch Container Insights
✔ FluentBit → CloudWatch Logs
✔ X-Ray for request tracing
✔ CloudTrail for EKS API activity

🧠 Data Processing, ETL, Analytics Related Services

To clear confusion between Glue, EMR, Athena etc.

🦋 AWS Glue (ETL)

Pipeline:
Source → Clean → Transform → Store

Example:
S3 raw logs → Glue → Parquet → Athena Query

❓ AWS Athena

Query S3 directly using SQL

🧠 Pairing:
Glue catalogs tables → Athena queries them

💡 AWS Lake Formation

Security for Data Lakes

Controls:
✔ table-level access
✔ column-level access
✔ masked access

For enterprise-level governance

🧠 MASTER MEMORY MAP (1-MINUTE RECALL)
Threat Detection

GuardDuty → anomalies, malicious activity

Inspector → vulnerabilities & CVEs

IAM Analyzer → overly exposed access

Compliance & Governance

Security Hub → central dashboard

AWS Config → continuous checks

Logging & Monitoring

CloudWatch → logs, metrics, alarms

CloudTrail → API operations history

Identity & Secrets

KMS → encryption and key lifecycle

Secrets Manager → rotate credentials

Parameter Store → cheaper alternative

Data Governance & ETL

Glue → ETL

Athena → SQL on S3

Lake Formation → access control

🎯 Best Interview Answers (copy style)

For real-time monitoring, I'd use CloudWatch for metrics and logs, CloudTrail to track user activity, and AWS Config to ensure that infrastructure remains compliant. If anomalies occur—like unusual access patterns—GuardDuty detects threats and Security Hub aggregates findings across services."

Or

“For vulnerability detection I'd use AWS Inspector, and for access exposure IAM Access Analyzer helps identify public or cross-account access.”
